# Supermarket Products - CLI Utility

A Python scraper that crawls the website of New Zealand supermarket, Countdown, for their product information. The client can then choose to upload the information to a MySQL database or simply store them as CSV files.

I'm using this tool to obtain food prices. I plan to create an application that helps people with their day-to-day cooking.
